	Cgroup(control grup) -> it is resposible for resource maagement like CPU, Memory, and Block I/O.
	UnionFS -> it is a file system service which is used for creating docker images layers


* How to check the details about any image?
	#docker inspect <imageName/imageID>

* How to check details about each layer in a docker images like size, task done, timestamp?

* What are the most common instructions you used while writing a dockerfile?
	FROM - we provide the base image
	ARG - it is used to pass the variable to docker at build
	LABEL - it is used to add meta data to the image.
	ENV -  it is used to awt the environemnt variable.
	WORKDIR - it is sued to set the conrking diectory
	RUN - it is used to excute any command	
	COPY - it is used to copy a new file or directory in the image
	ADD - it is same as copy and copyt the file from the remote loaction
	EXPOSE - it tell the docker that application will listen to which port
	CMD and ENTRYPOINT - it runs a command when container start from the given image

* I want to protect my sensitive data and avoid adding few files/folder like .git/tests while building an images. Is there any wayto control it?
	we can add the file or folder in ".dockerignore" file. ".dockerignore" can be in the same location of the docker file
		#vi .dockerignore
			.git/
			tests/
			.aws

* How to disconnect the node from the Kubernetes clster?
    we can use the below command to disconnect/drain the node from the cluster.
    #kubectl drain node-name
    
* How Kubernetes connect with node?
    we can use the below command to add the worker node.
        #kubeadm token create --print-join-command      ##run this command to the master node and then past the output to the new worker name.
        
* Which kubernetes version are you use?
    1.19
    
* What is the difference in scheduler?

* What are the differnet types of container?
    1. Single container
    2. Multi container
    3. sidecar container
    4. init container
    
* Where we can choose the multi container pod?
    We can choose multicontainer where one pod has the dependency with other pod. 

* How to login to the multi container pod?

* What is the difference between Statefulset and Deployment?
    The primary difference between is, in Statefulset, it is a sticky identification. it depends on the hostname. 
    if the container goes does down then it will up gain with the same name and the same suffix. This is helpful when we need cluster lind of deplyoment.

* What the objects you use in the K8s?
    1. Deploument
    2. Config Maps
    3. secret
    4. service account
    5. Cluster role
    6. Cluster role bindings
 
 * What is the use of service account?
    it provide the access to the some other servie to use the k8s cluster.
    
 * How to access the application from outside the Kubernestes ?  
    we can use service of "NodePort" type to access the application from outside the K*s cluseter.
 
 * What is the use of cluster IP in the K8s cluster?
 
 
 * What is headless service?
 
 * What are the types of service?
    ther are primarily 3 type od service.
        1. NodePort – the service makes an internal pod accessible on a port on the node.
        2. ClusterIP – The service creates a virtual IP inside the cluster to enable commination between different services 
                       such as a set of front-end server to a set of back end servers.
        3. Load balancer – We provisions a load balancer for our application in supported cloud provides.
        4. ExternalName - This maps the service to the contents of the externalName field (e.g., foo.bar.example.com). 
                          It does this by returning a value for the CNAME record.

 
* What is the high level diagram for Kubernetes?
    The kubernetes follow master-worker achitehture. The master has the view componet and the work has the few compoent.
    master Component are:
        1. Controller manager - it is resposible for running controllers.
        2. Scheduler - it identifies the right node to place a container on based on the containers
        3. API Server - it is primary management component of Kubernetes. it exposes the k8s API.
        4. ETCD - it is a database that stores information in a key value format.
    Worker Component are:
        1. kubeproxy - it responsible for communication between the worker nodes. 
        2. kubelet - it is an agent that runs on each node in a cluster. 
                     It listen the instruction from the Kubernetes API server and deploys or destroy containers on the nodes as required
        3. Container runtime - it is resposible for running containers.Currently, K8s supports both Docker and Rocket containers.

What is the command to join the new node to the k8s cluster?
What is the difference in docker swarn and Kubernetes?

    How to boot the server in runlavel 4 and how to enable network in run level 4?
    * Explain boot process?
        1. BIOS (Basic Input output System). This will check physical hardware of the system and executes the MBR
        2. MBR (Master boot Record)- this will executes the Grub
        3. Grub (Grand unified Bootloader) - this will executes the kernel and mount the initramfs in a read only mode
        4. kernel - The kernel loads driver modules from initramfs and start the systemd process.
        5. Systemd - starts the default target.
        6. target - 

    * Explain the run level?
        below is the runlevel
            runlevel0.target (System halt/shutdown)

            emergency.target (Emergency mode)

    * How to go to the single user mode?
    * What is the difference between initrd and Initramfs?
        Initrd is deprecated, replaced by Initramfs,
        initrd was block device based, initramfs is file base.
        with initrd, you created a file system image. with initramfs, you create an archive with the files which the kernel extracts to a tmpfs.
    
    * How  does initram disk create?
        initrd can be created with “mkinitrd” command. The location of initrd is /boot directory. 
        The kernel version for which the initrd image is being created needs to be passed as an argument to the mkinitrd command.
            #mkinitrd /boot/initrd-latest.img $(uname -r)
            
    * How initram disk depends on kernel version?
        The kernel converts initrd into a “normal” RAM disk and frees the memory used by initrd
